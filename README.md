Project: Rock Paper Scissors from The Odin Project fundamentals course. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

Since i'm not an experienced developer the game only runs in the console.
That means you need to open your developer tools in your webrowser. If you're using a MAC you can press: Command + Option + I. then press Console.

After doing that press the button labeled as "play" and you'll be fine. :D
